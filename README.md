ABookOnC
========

I intended to start this two summers ago, but winter break afforded me this opportunity to brush up on C. I'm working through "A Book on C by Al Kelley and Ira Pohl" (ISBN: 978-0-201-18399-3). 

My goal is to finish by January 28th, when the next semester begins for me at Brooklyn College. I'll have to do between 30-35 pages every day to finish on the 27th. Given that I'm also trying to read two other similarly sized books by then, I don't know how successful I'll be, but here's to another adventure.

**29 pages, about an hour** I've worked through the first 29 pages of the book, until unit 1.7. Covered so far: variables, data types, format characters, control structures. I knew a lot of this material already, but I learned two cool string formats. The `%e` format is scientific notation, and the `%g` format chooses the shorter version from scientific or decimal notation. 

January 6, 2015 (Day 2)

**13 pages, 45 minutes** I covered only half of my goal today because I started at midnight. Tomorrow I have to do 45 pages to stay on track. Tonight covered: functions, strings, and arrays. Bubble sort, and  getchar and putchar made cameos. Up next are pointers and file I/O.

January 9, 2015 (Day 3)

**35 pages, 2 hours** I've fallen behind, but if I do 35 pages daily, I'll finish on time. 

Tonight took longer than usual because I finally configured vim with a .vimrc, and got a little distracted. (For some reason my Mac is using GCC 4.2.1 instead of LLVM.) I did end up annotating my textbook and practicing a bit though. I covered pointers (variable vs. constant) basic file I/O, a little bit of light reading on file system considerations.

The conversation in this book about lexical elements and tokens was fascinating. Some of the material looked like it came straight out of my Theory of Computation class from last semester.
